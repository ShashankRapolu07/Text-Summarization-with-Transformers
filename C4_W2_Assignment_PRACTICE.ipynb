more\nthan 100 residents on a street following health and safety fears -\nover wonky paving slabs. Residents on the Victorian estate in Stoke-\non-Trent, Staffordshire, are now forced to make a four-mile round trip\ncollect their letters and parcels from a central depot. Royal Mail\npostmen are refusing to deliver to The Villas after it became a no-go\nzone due to 'a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and\nslipping'. Resident Catherine Burgass said the move by Royal Mail has\n'annoyed' all of the residents at The Villas. Yesterday home-owners on\nthe road, which is not council-maintained as it is privately run by\nthe residents' association, said their mail had been delivered without\na problem for 150 years and slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any\nwarning. The estate's residents' association has asked Royal Mail to\nidentify which areas need repairing but say it would cost tens of\nthousands of pounds to tarmac the entire stretch. Elderly resident\nAlfred Poole, 79, branded the move 'barmy'. He said: 'Its health and\nsafety gone mad. I'm an old man and if I can manage the paving slabs,\nI'm sure the postman can. 'I haven't got a car and I can't walk four\nmiles to fetch my post. It's just ridiculous.' Royal Mail say they\nsuspended deliveries to the street for health and safety reasons\nfollowing 'incidents' Julian Wilshaw, 38, who lives with his partner\nSarah and daughter Jessica, added: 'It came out of the blue. 'We had\nheard nothing at all about it and then the letter came through. 'We\nweren't even warned or informed there was an issue, so we could maybe\ntry to help put any issues right. 'Royal Mail deliver to the likes of\nthe Isle of Skye and the Hebrides - we're just The Villas, in Stoke.\n'My daughter has hip problems and we're waiting on a letter from the\nhospital. 'I have sympathy for the postmen if they've hurt themselves,\nbut we don't know what the problem is, and Royal Mail have been\ndelivering to us for years. 'It's a massive inconvenience for all the\nresidents, especially the more elderly people living here.' A total of\n40 households and over 100 residents have been affected by the ban. Ms\nBurgass said the pavement has been in the same condition since she\nmoved in 15 years ago. Martin Parker, 52, secretary of The Villas\nResidents' Association, said: 'The letter said one postman had injured\nthemselves a month ago, and we were told it happened again a couple of\ndays before the letter was sent. 'No-one had been consulted about any\nproblems with the state of the pavements and I'm surprised they hadn't\nbothered to consult with us. 'It would have been sensible for them to\nspeak to us, and it's bizarre Royal Mail has taken this rather extreme\nstance. 'The road is not slippery, our bins are emptied and post had\nbeen delivered here for a very long time. 'Luckily, I have a car and\nI'm physically fit, but there are quite a few elderly residents and\nthere's the care home here too. 'Also, no-one seems to be able to\ncontact the phone number attached with the letter.' Doug Burnham, 49,\nwho has lived on The Villas for 15 years, added: 'It's a very\ndifficult situation. I can't see how our neighbourhood differs from\nany other neighbourhood. Residents have slammed Royal Mail for not\ngiving them any warning about the cancellation of the service.\n'Sweeping and cleaning is something we do as often as possible. We\nalso tackle things like potholes, drainage issues and fly-tipping. 'We\nare open to discussions. 'We would be willing to pay if there were\nparticularly problematic areas and we do that anyway, but obviously we\ncouldn't do the entirety of the paving.' Resident Catherine Burgass,\n47, added: 'I was extremely surprised we had not had any prior\nwarning. 'The pavement has been in the same condition since I moved in\n15 years ago. 'Everybody's annoyed about it.' A Royal Mail\nspokesperson said: 'We have taken the decision to suspend deliveries\nto a small number of addresses after a number of incidents involving\ncolleagues falling and slipping. 'Our priority is the safety of our\npeople and we apologise to customers.'<EOS><pad>RoyalMail say they\nhave suspended deliveries after 'a number of incidents' which saw\ndelivery drivers fall and slip on the private Victorian road. But\nresidents say post has been delivered for 150 years with no issues.\nResidents claim they had no warning about the cancellation of the\nservice. A total of 40 households and more than 100 residents are\naffected by the ban.<EOS>\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Bucketing\nboundaries =  [128, 256,  512, 1024]\nbatch_sizes = [16,    8,    4,    2, 1]\n\ntrain_batch_stream = trax.data.BucketByLength(\n    boundaries, batch_sizes)(train_stream)\neval_batch_stream = trax.data.BucketByLength(\n    boundaries, batch_sizes)(eval_stream)\n\ninput_batch, _, mask_batch = next(train_batch_stream)\n\nprint(input_batch.shape)\nprint(input_batch[0])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-19T09:43:11.493423Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-19T09:43:11.493794Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-19T09:43:11.513716Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-19T09:43:11.493764Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-19T09:43:11.512798Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"(1, 1054)\n[ 1096  6318 11454 ...  5933    10     1]\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(detokenize(input_batch[0]))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-19T09:43:24.043107Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-19T09:43:24.043519Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-19T09:43:24.241819Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-19T09:43:24.043486Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-19T09:43:24.240698Z"},"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Michael Higdon came off the bench and scored two late goals to send\nNigel Clough’s Sheffield United into the quarter-finals.

Delle Alli, the 18-year-old starlet with\na wealth of admirers in high places, enticed a foul in the box with an\nelectric run before Benfik Afobe, 21, an on-loan Arsenal striker\nconfidently netted from the spot for his sixth Capital One Cup goal of\nthe season. Alli lit up the second round as MK Dons dispatched\nManchester United 4-0. This fourth-round tie had little of the magic\nof that occasion but Alli again showed why he is being courted by the\nlikes of Liverpool and Arsenal. MK Dons breakthrough came in the 66th\nminute when Alli was brought down by Craig Alcock and Afobe coolly\nslotted home. It was a rare moment of quality until the dramatic late\nfinish. If one action summed up a lacklustre first half it was United\ndefender Robert Harris’s free kick from 25 yards out in the 40th\nminute which he lamely lifted high and wide. MK Dons started brightly,\nwith Afobe coming close to connecting with a looping ball into the box\nfrom Tom Flanagan in the second minute. Afobe admitted wanting to\nimpress Arsene Wenger, ahead of his contract running out at the end of\nthis season. Holding midfielder Alli looks a classy prospect and\nlinked up well with Afobe. Alli sparkled in the second half, skipping\naway from challenges and creating space for his teammates. But it was\nthe United who dominated the opening stages of the second half. Clough\nshook his head in disbelief as his side failed to score in the second\nminute after the break when a group of players in the box lunged for\nthe ball but missed the chance to score. Clough again had head in\nhands when Stefan Scougall headed over by he was dancing with joy at\nthe final whistle thanks to Higdon’s heroics. There was plenty of\ngrabbing and grappling in the box in the second minute of the second\nhalf when several Sheffield United players were held by MK Dons\ndefenders. This went unpunished by referee Roger East. East was more\ninclined to reach for his book when Dele Alli was floored by a sliding\ntackle by Craig Alcock. heffield United manager Nigel Clough looks on\nduring the Fourth Round tie.
